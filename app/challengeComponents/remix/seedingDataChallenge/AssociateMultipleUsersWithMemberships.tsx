        To create an intermediate level membership user, we will need to call on
        the
        <InlineMonoType darkMode>intermediateMembership</InlineMonoType> seed
        that was created earlier.

        Add this code block directly beneath the basic user created in the last
        step:

      <div className="my-6">
        <CodeBlock

        page.
