        Now that we are getting the{" "}

        into the backend <InlineMonoType darkMode>action</InlineMonoType>{" "}

      <Paragraph darkMode>
        Firstly, open{" "}

          app/models/membership.server.ts

        add the function below to the end of the file:

            This is a backend function that takes two arguments:{" "}

          1. Can you offer a way for users to cancel their membership
          altogether?
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph challengeBlock>
          You have already written much of the code for this already. You simply
          need an option on the form to cancel user memberships. But what value
          will you send in the form's cancel membership option?
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph challengeBlock>
          2. Can you customise the memberships page design to make it more
          appealing? Look at the example below for some ideas:
